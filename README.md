# CUB3D
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It made me explore ray-casting. The goal is to make a dynamic view inside a maze.

# Goals
- You must create a “realistic” 3D graphicalrepresentation of the inside of a maze from a first-person perspective. You have to create this representation using the Ray-Casting principles.
- This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc..
- As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
- To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
- With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.
